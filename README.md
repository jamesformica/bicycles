# Bicycles

I asked colleagues to draw a bicycle from memory and this is the result. Enjoy!

_A note to the artists: I genuinely did not mean a word in the captions I wrote. I had a lot of fun with all of you and thank you greatly for indulging me in this silly experiment. You are all artists in your own special ways!_
